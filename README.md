<h3>💡Concepts💡</h3>
- Students are always busy with school with many workloads and class schedules. Sometimes, they used to miss important deadlines and cannot make a study plan because they get overwhelmed by pressure. SchoolMate can help students to improve their GPA, but also to succeed in their university life. 

<h3>🎯Our solution🎯</h3>
- SchoolMate provides personalized schedules for every single student, who wishes to improve their GPA and create effective schedules to manage their school workload. It shows how many hours you study for a specific course, and tell which course you need to study more. Also, there is a progress status so that students can see how much percentage they accomplish their study goals. It inspires them to keep studying harder.

## 2. Challenge Question - Pain Points for Carriers 🚚 <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white">
This is the Challenge Question from 123LoadBoard as part of the 12th Edition of McGill CodeJam.

The question choosed by Team Clueless 

Staying Awake while Driving 💤 ⚡ Problem Carriers drive large trucks for several hours straight, and if they are not well rested, they can experience fatigue and sleepiness on the road. Drowsiness while driving is hazardous for carriers and surrounding drivers. Keeping carriers awake and alert could save lives.

<h3>💡Concepts💡</h3>
- A carrier is a trucker that moves loads of merchandise from point A to point B. A broker posts loads they need delivered on load boards to try to get their loads hauled by a carrier. A pain point is a common issue or problem faced by carriers and brokers that makes their jobs more difficult.

<h3>🎯Our solution🎯</h3>
- Does your drivers ever find themself dowsing off while driving long distance? Sweat no more, this algorithm can save the day. By monitoring change in speed, it can alert drivers by rewarding good driver and penalizing bad drivers.

<h4>Inspiration</h4>
- Sometimes driving long distances can be boring. A system that monitors and rewards good driving can increase driving quality. 

<h4>What it does</h4>
- This algorithm monitors the change in speed and acceleration and checks if the driver is being reckless, breaking too hard or even dozing off. ## How we built it We built this algorithm using Visual Studio Code as our IDE and Python as our programming language. 

<h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
- The challenge we ran into was to generate variation in speed and acceleration in the most natural way possible. 

<h4>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h4>
The algorithm can check for four different states; A good driver, a dangerous driver, a driver breaking too hard or a driver dozing off. 

<h4>What we learned</h4> 
- We learned how to work efficiently as a team and how to use GitHub to commit, push and pull code from a repository. 

<h4>What's next for Quality Driver</h4>
- 123loadboard Improve driving quality with real-world data and implement a reward/reputation system to incentivize better driving.
